= sequel-postgres-pr

This is a library to access PostgreSQL from pure Ruby, without any C library,
with the goal of proper functioning with Sequel's postgres adapter.

The only supported PostgreSQL authentication methods are password and md5. SSL
is not supported. COPY and LISTEN are not supported.

This requires Sequel 5.59.0.  For older versions of Sequel, please use the
jeremyevans-postgres-pr gem.
